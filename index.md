I am currently a Research Scientist at Meta working on applied ML for Ads. 

Before this, I completed my PhD in Machine Learning at the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at Imperial College London, advised by [William Knottenbelt](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/). My research interests are in machine learning. Specifically, I (mainly) worked on reinforcement learning and imitation learning, as well as problems in computer vision and generative modeling. My undergraduate degree prior to the PhD was at Imperial as well, where I was awarded an MEng in Electronic and Information Engineering with First-class honours.

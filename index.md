I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at Imperial College London, advised by [William Knottenbelt](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/). My research interests are in machine learning. Specifically I work on reinforcement learning, imitation learning and associated fields. 

Prior to this, I was an undergrad student in the [EEE Department](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) at Imperial. 

In my free time I practice martial arts, mainly Karate and Wing Chun with dashes of other forms. I also enjoy tennis, both as a spectator and as a player.

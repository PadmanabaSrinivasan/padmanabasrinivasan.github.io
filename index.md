I am currently a Research Scientist at Meta working on applied ML for Ads. 

Prior to this, I was a PhD student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at Imperial College London, advised by [William Knottenbelt](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/). My research interests are in machine learning. Specifically, I mainly worked on reinforcement learning and imitation learning, as well as some problems in computer vision and generative modeling.

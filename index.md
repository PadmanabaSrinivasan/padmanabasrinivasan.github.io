I am currently a Research Scientist at Meta working on applied ML for Ads revenue and ranking. 

Prior to this, I was a PhD student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at Imperial College London, advised by [William Knottenbelt](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/). My research interests are in machine learning. Specifically I work on reinforcement learning, imitation learning and associated fields.
